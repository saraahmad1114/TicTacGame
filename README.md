Creating a Tic Tac Toe Game

The game of tic tac toe is a very simple one considering it is assessing whether there same values horizontally, vertically, or diagonally exist. 

For the creation of this game I utilized the tag method to keep track of all the X's and O's which served as buttons. Based on the tags and the presence of those buttons, I compared them to the combinations that would allow for winning to occur. 

Lastly I accounted for a draw if no one had won the game, also using the winning combinations, similar to indeces in an array.
